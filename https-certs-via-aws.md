# Lab: Adding HTTPS Certificates via Load Balancer and Targets to EC2 Instance

## Objective
Configure an AWS Application Load Balancer with HTTPS certificates and targets to serve an EC2 instance hosting a web application.

## Architecture Overview

    User[User Browser] -- HTTPS:443 --> ALB[Application Load Balancer]
    ALB -- HTTP:80 --> TG[Target Group]
    TG -- HTTP:80 --> EC2[EC2 Instance]
    ACM[AWS Certificate Manager] --> ALB
    Route53[AWS Route 53 DNS] --> ALB
```


## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Route 53, and AWS Certificate Manager.
- An existing EC2 instance running a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
- A registered domain name.


## Step 1: Obtain an SSL/TLS Certificate

### Using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

- Choose **"Request a certificate"** if you want AWS to manage your certificate automatically.

1. **Navigate to AWS Certificate Manager**:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and select the AWS Certificate Manager service.
2. **Request Certificate**:
    - Follow the wizard to request or import a certificate for your domain.
3. **Validate Domain Ownership**:
    - Use email validation or DNS validation to prove domain ownership.
4. **Wait for Certificate Issuance**:
    - Once validated, AWS will issue your certificate.

## Step 2: Create a Target Group

1. **Navigate to Elastic Load Balancing**:
    - In the AWS Management Console, go to the Elastic Load Balancing service.
2. **Create a Target Group**:
    - Click on "Target groups" and then "Create target group".
    - Choose "Instances" as the target type.
    - Set the protocol to HTTP and port to 80 (or your web server's port).
    - Select your EC2 instance.
3. **Configure Health Checks**:
    - Health check protocol: HTTP
    - Path: `/` (or any path returning HTTP status code `200`)
    - Interval: `30 seconds`
    - Timeout: `5 seconds`
    - Healthy threshold: `3`
    - Unhealthy threshold: `3`

## Step 3: Create an Application Load Balancer

1. **Create a Load Balancer**:
    - In Elastic Load Balancing dashboard, click on "Load balancers" and then "Create load balancer".
    - Choose "Application Load Balancer".
    - Set the scheme to "internet-facing".
2. **Configure Listeners**:
    - Create an HTTPS listener on port `443`.
    - Select your SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager.
    - Forward traffic to your target group.
3. **Add HTTP Listener (Optional)**:
    - Create an HTTP listener on port `80`.
    - Add a rule to redirect all traffic from port `80` (HTTP) to port `443` (HTTPS).
4. **Select Availability Zones**:
    - Ensure the load balancer is enabled in the same Availability Zone as your EC2 instance.

## Step 4: Configure Security Groups

You should have two separate security groups: one for your EC2 instance and one for your Load Balancer.

- **EC2 Security Group**:
    - Allow inbound HTTP traffic (port 80) from the Load Balancer security group's ID.
- **Load Balancer Security Group**:
    - Allow inbound HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).


## Step 5: Update A Records in Hosted Zone

### Point Domain Name to Load Balancer

1. **Navigate to Route 53**:
    - Go to the AWS Management Console and select the Route 53 service.
2. **Select Your Hosted Zone**:
    - Choose the hosted zone corresponding to your domain name.
3. **Create or Update A Records**:
    - Click "Create record set" or edit existing A record.
    - Set **Name** as your domain name (e.g., `randombusiness.tech`) or subdomain.
    - Set **Type** as A â€“ IPv4 address.
    - Set **Alias** as "Yes".
    - Select your load balancer's DNS name in the Alias target dropdown.
4. **Save Changes**:
    - Click "Create records" or "Save changes".

### Using AWS CLI

Replace `ZONE_ID` and DNS names accordingly:

```bash
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
--hosted-zone-id ZONE_ID \
--change-batch '{
    "Changes": [{
        "Action": "UPSERT",
        "ResourceRecordSet": {
            "Name": "randombusiness.tech",
            "Type": "A",
            "AliasTarget": {
                "DNSName": "lbWebServerAuto-1810038198.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com",
                "HostedZoneId": "Z32O12XQLNTSW2",
                "EvaluateTargetHealth": false
            }
        }
    }]
}'
```


## Step 6: Test Your Setup

### Verify HTTPS Connection

1. **Access Your Website**:
    - Use your domain name or load balancer's DNS name over HTTPS.
2. **Verify Certificate**:
    - Confirm that SSL/TLS certificate is correctly applied and trusted by browsers.

## Step 7: Update WordPress Configuration (If Applicable)

### Update Site URLs

1. **Access WordPress Admin Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Settings > General**.
3. Update both **WordPress Address (URL)** and **Site Address (URL)** fields with HTTPS URLs.

## Conclusion

You have successfully configured an Application Load Balancer with HTTPS certificates and targets serving an EC2 instance hosting a web application. Ensure all resources are correctly configured and test thoroughly.

### Additional Tips

- **Monitor Load Balancer Logs**
Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring load balancer logs for errors or unusual patterns.
- **Use AWS CLI for Automation**
Automate tasks like creating load balancers and target groups using AWS CLI commands.
- **Security Best Practices**
Regularly review security group configurations ensuring least privilege principles.
