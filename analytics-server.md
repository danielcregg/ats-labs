# How To Install Matomo Analytics Server

## Introduction

Matomo is an open-source web analytics application. Please note, it was formerly called Piwik, so you may see some references to the old name. It rivals Google Analytics and includes even more features, allowing you to send out custom daily, weekly, and monthly reports to your clients. Here is a video to explain: *Your introduction to Matomo Analytics!*

## Downloading and Unzipping Matomo

First, update your system packages to ensure you have the latest versions:

```bash
sudo dnf update
```

Install the required tools for downloading and extracting Matomo:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y wget unzip
```

Download the latest version of Matomo:

```bash
sudo wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo.zip -P ~
```

Extract the downloaded Matomo zip file to your web server directory:

```bash
sudo unzip -o ~/matomo.zip -d /var/www/html
```

## Assigning Permissions

Set the appropriate ownership for the Matomo directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/matomo
```

Set the required permissions for the temporary directory:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html/matomo/tmp
```

Restart the Apache web server to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

## Creating the Database

Now we need to create a database for our analytics server. We will call the database `matomodb`. Run the following commands exactly, **one command at a time**:

First, access the MySQL command line interface:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

Create a new database for Matomo:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE matomodb;
```

Create a database user for Matomo:

```bash
CREATE USER 'matomoadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Grant all privileges on the Matomo database to the user:

```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON matomodb.* TO 'matomoadmin'@'localhost';
```

Apply the privilege changes:

```bash
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit the MySQL command line:

```bash
exit;
```

## Configuration via GUI

Browse to your matomo server dashboard by going to:

```
https://yourwebsiteaddress/matomo
```

Click *Next* and you will run through the system check. Everything should pass; if not, make sure LAMP is properly installed and configured.

### Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues, delete the database and database users and start again. **DO NOT RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IF EVERYTHING IS WORKING**:

Access the MySQL command line as the root user:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

View all MySQL users:

```bash
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
```

Delete the Matomo database user:

```bash
DROP USER 'matomoadmin'@'localhost';
```

List all databases:

```bash
SHOW DATABASES;
```

Delete the Matomo database:

```bash
DROP DATABASE matomodb;
```

Apply the privilege changes:

```bash
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Exit the MySQL command line:

```bash
exit;
```
