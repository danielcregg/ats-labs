# How To Install Matomo Analytics Server

## Introduction

Matomo is an open-source web analytics application. Please note, it was formerly called Piwik, so you may see some references to the old name. It rivals Google Analytics and includes even more features, allowing you to send out custom daily, weekly, and monthly reports to your clients. Here is a video to explain: *Your introduction to Matomo Analytics!*

## Downloading and Unzipping Matomo

These commands will download and extract the latest version of Matomo:

```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install -y wget unzip
sudo wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo.zip -P ~
sudo unzip -o ~/matomo.zip -d /var/www/html
```

## Assigning Permissions

The command above created a new directory inside `/var/www/html/`. Now we need to give the appropriate permissions to that directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/matomo
sudo chmod -R 0755 /var/www/html/matomo/tmp
```

You will now need to restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

## Creating the Database

Now we need to create a database for our analytics server. We will call the database `matomodb`. Run the following commands exactly, **one command at a time**:

```bash
sudo mysql
```
```bash
CREATE DATABASE matomodb;
```
```bash
CREATE USER 'matomoadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON matomodb.* TO 'matomoadmin'@'localhost';
```
```bash
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
```bash
exit;
```

## Configuration via GUI

Browse to your server by going to:

```
https://yourwebsiteaddress/matomo
```

Click *Next* and you will run through the system check. Everything should pass; if not, make sure LAMP is properly installed and configured.

Now you will configure the database you already set up. Just use the appropriate credentials and then click *Next*. For password, use `password`.

Upon successful database setup, you should see a confirmation screen.

Next, create an admin user. Call the **Super user login** `admin` and take note of your password. Put your email address in the email box.

Now we need to add our website. Fill out the following fields.

Finally, read through the setup summary, untick the unnecessary boxes, and hit *Continue to Matomo*.

## Logging In

Finally, log in with your super user account.

## WordPress Plugin Installation

Next, go to the *Plugins* section on your WordPress dashboard and install the **WP-Matomo** plugin. Click *Install Now*, wait for the *Install Now* text to change to *Activate*, then click *Activate*.

Once you have activated the Matomo Plugin, head over to **Settings > WP-Piwik** and fill out your server information. We will get the Auth Token in the next step.

Login to Matomo:

```
http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/matomo/index.php
```

Use the **Admin username** and the **Admin password** you set earlier. Select the **cogwheel icon** on the top right of the toolbar.

Then select **Security** on the left-hand menu under the **Personal** section. Click on the **CREATE NEW TOKEN** button under the *Auth tokens* section.

Enter your admin password and click *Confirm*.

Fill in the description, then hit *CREATE NEW TOKEN*.

Your new token should now appear. Copy it and hit the big green *Confirm* button.

Copy that token over to your WordPress site and click *Save Changes*.

## Configuring WordPress Dashboard Settings

Configure the settings you would like to show on your dashboard and click *Save Changes*.

Now, you need to enable the tracking. Select **Default tracking**, change any settings you'd like, and hit *Save*.

Go to your WordPress dashboard, and you will notice extra Matomo panels.

If you go to your Matomo dashboard by opening a browser and navigating to:

```
http://YourServerIPaddress/matomo/
```

You will see information about your website. Initially, it will be blank, waiting for new stats to be generated. Wait for an hour and then check the Matomo dashboard again.

### Congratulations! 🎉

You have installed Matomo on your Amazon Linux 2023 web server and configured the Matomo plugin on your WordPress site. Now, get three hits on your site—use your phone, desktop, and ask a friend to connect. Search the results and see what information you can find.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues, delete the database and database users and start again. **DO NOT RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IF EVERYTHING IS WORKING**:

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
DROP USER 'matomoadmin'@'localhost';
SHOW DATABASES;
DROP DATABASE matomodb;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
```
